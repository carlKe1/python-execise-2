# When playing games where you have to roll two dice, it is nice to know the odds of each
# roll. For instance, the odds of rolling a 12 are about 3%, and the odds of rolling a 7 are about
# 17%. You can compute these mathematically, but if you donâ€™t know the math, you can write
# a program to do it. To do this, your program should simulate rolling two dice about 10,000
# times and compute and print out the percentage of rolls that come out to be 2, 3, 4, . . . , 12
